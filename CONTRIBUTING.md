## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Example Function Documentation

```python
def process_data(df: pd.DataFrame, column: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Process dataframe by cleaning and transforming data.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): Input dataframe to process
        column (str): Name of the column to transform

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: Processed dataframe

    Raises:
        ValueError: If column doesn't exist in dataframe
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```
